		<h1>ARIA 1.2 Candidate Recommendation Implementation Information</h1>
		<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-wai-aria-1.1-20161027/">ARIA 1.2</a> was published as a W3C Candidate Recommendation on DD MM 2020.</p>
		<section>
			<h2>How to test WAI-ARIA</h2>
			<p>The markup language features defined by WAI-ARIA are processed by user agents in
				accordance with the <a href="/TR/core-aam/">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a> and
					<a href="/TR/accname-aam/">Accessible Name and Description: Computation and
					Accessiblity API Mappings</a>, which defines how WAI-ARIA features are exposed
				to platform accessibility APIs. Because there are several accessibility APIs on
				several operating systems that each have several user agents, the goal is to
				demonstrate that there are at least two interoperable passing examples for each test
				on any two combinations of user agent plus operating system plus accessibility API.
				Two implemenations of each <em>feature</em> are required, but not two
				implementations of each <em>mapping</em>.</p>
			<p>WAI-ARIA will be tested by examining how user agents that consume ARIA-enhanced HTML
				content directly represent and respond to it in accessibility APIs. Implementations
				are discrete combinations of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a user agent, </li>
				<li>on a given operating system,</li>
				<li>exposing content to a given accessibility API. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>A given user agent, operating system, or accessibility API may participate in several
				combinations that form discrete implementations. </p>
			<p>Most assistive technologies interact with ARIA-enhanced content via the accessibility
				API in the same manner as they do with desktop applications. Specific rules for this
				are out of scope for WAI-ARIA and assistive technology behavior will <em>not</em> be
				tested as a formal part of the Candidate Recommendation process. Some assistive
				technology testing may be performed to provide advisory information for Web content
				authors.</p>
			<p>The following types of tests will be executed: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Unit tests</strong> for proper handling of each ARIA role, state /
					property, and state / property value, separately from each other. Error
					conditions, such as use of unknown or abstract roles, invalid values, invalid
					application of states and properties, etc. will also be tested.</li>
				<li><strong>Feature tests</strong> for specific objects that require several
					WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties together to assemble the feature, such as
					widgets that require several states or properties in addition to the role, and
					complex objects that require several elements with various ARIA roles to work
					together. Specific features include each widget that uses states and properties
					beyond global ones, and features that require the interaction of two or more
					elements with ARIA roles. </li>
				<li><strong>Dynamic tests</strong> that modify document roles, states, properties,
					and associated HTML content, and verify that these are reflected correctly in
					accessibility API mappings, and that user agents generate the appropriate
					accessibility API events in response to these changes.</li>
				<li>Any normative statement using the RFC2119 MUST keyword that is not covered by
					the above categories.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Only features that are new or changed in ARIA 1.2 (from ARIA 1.1) will be tested. </p>

			<h2>Testing procedure</h2>
			<p>For ARIA 1.2, the Working Group hopes to perform <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/ARIA_1.1_Automated_Testing">automated testing</a>. This testing depends on development of <a href="https://spec-ops.github.io/atta-api/index.html">Accessible Technology Test Adapters</a>. If ATTAs are not available for certain platforms, manual testing will have to be performed. Test results will be aggregated in the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/test-results/wai-aria/all.html">Web Platform Tests report</a>.</p>
			<!--
		<h2>WAI Encourages a Broad Range of "Test Drives" </h2>
		<p>The primary purpose of this Candidate Recommendation stage is for developers and
			designers to "test drive" WAI-ARIA to demonstrate that it can be implemented in user
			agents. The Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group now needs the Web
			development community to help.</p>
		<p><strong> Implementation experience from all sources is welcome to help demonstrate this
				diversity. </strong></p>
		<h2>Working Together on Implementation Experience</h2>
		<p> Here's our plan to make the process effective and efficient for those sharing
			implementation experience, and for the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working
			Group:</p>
		<p>@@</p>
		-->
			<p>At any time, you can <strong>send any questions about this process or your
					implementation experience to <a href="mailto:public-aria@w3.org"
						>public-aria@w3.org</a></strong>.</p>
